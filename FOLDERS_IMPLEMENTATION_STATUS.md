python manage.py runserver

# Frontend
npm run dev
```

## 📝 Notes

- Backend is fully complete and tested (migrations created)
- API layer (types + clients) is complete
- Only UI components remain
- All APIs follow RESTful conventions
- Folder deletion uses SET_NULL, so webhooks aren't deleted
- Supports nested folders for future enhancement
